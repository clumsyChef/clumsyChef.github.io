		<h1>Welcome to my amazing SPA website.</h1>
		<h3>No libraries were used to create this website.</h3>

		<h3>Intro:</h3>
		<p>Hi, my name is <b>Sarthak Jha.</b> I am a front end developer.</p>
		<p>
			When I chose to pursue a career in development, I harbored lofty aspirations akin to, "Someday, I'll craft
			something akin to Facebook or Flappy Bird and ascend to billionaire status." Familiar ring to it, doesn't
			it?
			<br />
			Instead I'm here writing terrible english and asking ChatGIPPTY to re write it.
			<br />
			<button id="show-gippty" onclick="createPopup(this)" data-img-link="../assests/gippty.png">
				Show what I asked Gippty to do.
			</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have watched so much motivational videos that all the success stories I saw actually make me feel more
			demotivated.
		</p>
		<p>To ignite a fire inside of me i tried multiple things like:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>SNo.</th>
					<th>Tried</th>
					<th>Hoped</th>
					<th>Reality</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>1.</td>
					<td>Use NVIM (neovim)</td>
					<td>I will be super cool and genius</td>
					<td>
						Wasted horrendous amounts of time configuring it. (I tried to be like
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife" target="_blank">devaslife</a>, cool channel though)
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2.</td>
					<td>Dabbled into different tech</td>
					<td>I will become good at everyone</td>
					<td>
						Ended never using them so forgot everything. (Should've tried to become better at what I do)
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3.</td>
					<td>Started using Linux on main system</td>
					<td>Everyone will respect me</td>
					<td>
						** Learned a lot. Used terminals, learned how to setup Nginx Servers, terminal commands. (This
						turned out to be actually really usefull, never gonna go back)
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4.</td>
					<td>Tried to copy Pros</td>
					<td>I will become like them</td>
					<td>
						I never felt more lost, I don't even know who I am anymore. What I like, what I wanna do. (Never
						do this, never loose your true self)
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<!-- <p>
			I had high hopes when i decided to become a developer somewhere in the lines of "One day I will create
			something like Facebook or Flappy birds and become a billionarire", sounds familiar doesnt it??
